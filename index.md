## Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a political scientist who uses computational methods and experiments to study political behavior in autocracies and the US. My major region of specialisation is Post-Soviet space.

I prefer to think that my research mainly focuses on one or several of the following fields:

- [x] Computational Political Behavior (**``CPB``**)
- [x] Political Communication (**``PC``**)
- [x] Comparative Political Psychology (**``CPP``**) 

<br/>
I plan/hope [insert degree of uncertainty here] to be **on the job market in 2025-26.**

## I am currently working on:


- *Visual political polarization:  How people look at political images and what they  
see (with [Olga Gasparyan](https://olgasparyan.com/))* (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**) (JMP-2)

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  Olga and I are proposing a new approach to understanding why some visuals depicting politics trigger polarized evaluations while others do not. We argue that the key to understanding this puzzle lies in how we analyze these images and what we consider an important analysis unit. Understanding this will improve our prediction of the effect that political images have on perceptions.  </font>  </p>
  
- *Media Choice and Audience Reaction: Evidence from Visual
Framing of Immigration in News Stories (with [Olga Gasparyan](https://olgasparyan.com/) and [Michelle Torres](http://smtorres.org/))* (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**)   

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  We explore how media outlets from different ideological perspectives visually frame a polarizing issue, immigration, and how their target audiences are likely to interpret these frames. We illustrate yet again that media bias is important to study, but this time from the perspective of a visual slant.  </font>  </p>
     
- *Using Visual Sentiment Labeling to Address Annotator Bias (with [Olga Gasparyan](https://olgasparyan.com/) and [Michelle Torres](http://smtorres.org/))* (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**)   

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  We point out an important limitation of studies that use at-scale approaches to address annotator bias. In addition to showing that some biases cannot be addressed, we provide a guide for how to proceed.  </font>  </p>


- *A Theory of Guided  Propaganda* (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**) (**``CPP``**)  (JMP-1)

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  Using machine learning tools, I am exploring the long-term structural properties of propaganda canvas that (could) affect persuation. The project is at the data mining stage. </font> </p>

- *Autocrat versus Challenger: Implicit and Explicit Political Support in Autocracies*  (**``CPP``**) 

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  To explain why citizens support or oppose dictatorial leadership, most approaches to studying political behavior and public opinion in autocracies focus on mass explicit preferences. I show that implicit preferences - people's gut attitudes about politics - represent a significant and yet undertstudied source of citizens' disruptive preferences against the regime and in support of dictators' opponents.  </font> </p>

The rest is in my [CV](https://esirotkina.github.io/main/resume.pdf).
