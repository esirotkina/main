## Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a political scientist who uses computational methods and experiments to study political behavior. My major region of specialization is post-Soviet space.

I prefer to think that my research mainly focuses on one or several of the following fields:

- [x] Computational Political Behavior (**``CPB``**)
- [x] Political Communication (**``PC``**)
- [x] Comparative Political Psychology (**``CPP``**) 

<br/>
I plan/hope [insert degree of uncertainty here] to be **on the job market in 2025-26.**

## I am currently working on:


- [Vision and Division: Democrats and Republicans Look at Political Images
Differently, Reflecting Their Attitude.](http://olgasparyan.com/documents/202405_SG_VisionDivision.pdf) (with [Olga Gasparyan](https://olgasparyan.com/)) (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**) (JMP-2)

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  Olga and I are proposing a new approach to understanding why some visuals depicting politics trigger polarized evaluations while others do not. We argue that the key to understanding this puzzle lies in how we analyze these images and what we consider an important analysis unit. Understanding this will improve our prediction of the effect that political images have on perceptions.  </font>  </p>
  
- [Media Choice and Audience Perceptions: Evidence from
Visual Framing of Immigration in News Stories.]([https://osf.io/4tfjx](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tcepn3ngtyg6sishdacn7/MediaBias2024.pdf?rlkey=wo5url36rf8diqnke0sb8me8k&st=dmeg9ubm&dl=0)) (with [Olga Gasparyan](https://olgasparyan.com/)) (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**)   

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  We explore how media outlets from different ideological perspectives visually frame a polarizing issue, immigration, and how their target audiences are likely to interpret these frames. We illustrate yet again that media bias is important to study, but this time from the perspective of a visual slant.  </font>  </p>
     
- [Decoding Visual Sentiment of Political Imagery.]([https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xhodmxd8ditqibbh004rx/Decoding.pdf?rlkey=20wognrrzi9fvaubc7xuv62pw&st=tvcjr54v&dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/u2br4onkm751kuy4os210/Decoding-Visual-Sentiment-of-Political-Imagery.pdf?rlkey=3chk75j6m2oax4a3n2bwrabsw&st=2av3k1em&dl=0)) (with [Olga Gasparyan](https://olgasparyan.com/)) (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**)   

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  We point out an important limitation of studies that use at-scale approaches to address annotator bias. In addition to showing that some biases cannot be addressed, we provide a guide for how to proceed.  </font>  </p>


- A Theory of Guided  Propaganda (**``CPB``**) (**``PC``**) (**``CPP``**)  (JMP-1)

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  By using machine learning tools, I am exploring persistent structural properties of political propaganda canvas that (could) affect persuasion in autocracy. The project is in the data mining phase. </font> </p>

- [Autocrat versus Challenger: Revealing Hidden Discontent through Implicit Political Attitudes.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nv2pwtfkpd6y5qwkrgclp/Sirotkina-Implicit-attitudes-VWAR.pdf?rlkey=xm133krd06ixvis3zrr1ozern&dl=0)  (**``CPP``**) 

<p style="margin-left: 45px;">  <font size="-3">  To explain why citizens support or oppose dictatorial leadership, most approaches to studying political behavior and public opinion in autocracies focus on mass explicit preferences. I show that implicit preferences - people's gut attitudes about politics - represent a significant and yet understudied source of citizens' disruptive preferences against the regime and in support of dictators' opponents.  </font> </p>

The rest is in my [CV](https://esirotkina.github.io/main/cv.pdf).
