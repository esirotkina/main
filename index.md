## Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a political scientist who uses computational methods and experiments to study political behavior in autocracies and the US. My major region of specialisation is Post-Soviet space.

I prefer to think that my research mainly focuses on one or several of the following fields:

- [x] Computational Political Behavior (``**CPB**``)
- [x]  Political Communication (``PC``)
- [x] Comparative Political Psychology (``CPP``) 

<br/>

I plan/hope [insert degree of uncertainty here] to be **on the job market in 2025-26.**
